          "content": "The Respironics V60 Ventilator is an assist ventilator intended to augment patient breathing. It is designed for spontaneously breathing individuals who require mechanical ventilation, including patients with respiratory failure, chronic respiratory insufficiency, or obstructive sleep apnea. The ventilator can support both pediatric and adult patients, and can be used for both noninvasive and invasive ventilation.\n\nThe ventilator offers a range of conventional pressure modes, including CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), PCV (pressure-controlled ventilation), and S/T (spontaneous/timed). It also offers the volume-targeted AVAPS (average volume-assured pressure support) mode, which combines the attributes of pressure-controlled and volume-targeted ventilation.\n\nThe ventilator uses Auto-Trak Sensitivity, which allows it to automatically compensate for unintentional leaks by maintaining a stable baseline and adjusting trigger and cycle thresholds for optimum patient-ventilator synchrony.\n\nThe ventilator's pneumatic system uses ambient air and high-pressure oxygen to deliver gas to the patient. The system compares the proximal (patient) pressure measurement with the ventilator outlet (machine) pressure, and adjusts the machine pressure to compensate for the pressure drop across the inspiratory filter, patient circuit, and humidifier. This helps ensure accurate and responsive pressure delivery and leak compensation.\n\nBreaths delivered by the ventilator are pressure controlled, with the exception of the AVAPS mode, in which the ventilator's applied pressure is automatically adjusted over several breaths to maintain a target tidal volume. The ventilator uses its unique Auto-Trak Sensitivity algorithm to adjust triggering and cycling automatically, without the need for the user to set these parameters."

          "content": "The ventilator must be connected to an appropriate medical-grade oxygen source that can deliver 100% oxygen regulated to 276 to 600 kPa (40 to 87 psig). To ensure accurate oxygen administration and monitor for contamination, an external oxygen monitor must be used.\n\nThe patient circuit, including the main flow (inspiratory) bacteria filter, proximal pressure line, and humidifier (if used), must be properly assembled and positioned. Precautions are provided to ensure the circuit is not pushed, pulled, or kinked during use, and to prevent possible patient injury or water damage to the ventilator from the humidifier.\n\nThe ventilator is powered by AC mains, with an optional internal backup battery that can power the ventilator for typically 6 hours. The battery must be fully charged before use, and its charge level should be checked regularly, as battery charge is reduced at low ambient temperatures or during continuous alarm conditions.\n\nTo start up the ventilator, the user powers it on with the ON/Shutdown key. A preoperational check must then be performed to verify the ventilator's safe operation, including alarm functionality. This check involves connecting a test lung, setting specific ventilation parameters, and verifying the ventilator's response to various alarm conditions, such as high inspiratory pressure, low tidal volume, patient disconnect, and patient circuit occlusion.\n\nShutting down the ventilator involves pressing the ON/Shutdown key and selecting \"Ventilator Shutdown\" from the displayed menu.\n\nThe graphical user interface (GUI) is used to navigate the ventilator's settings and functions. The touchscreen and navigation ring allow the user to select, adjust, activate, and confirm parameters. The GUI includes windows for adjusting modes, settings, alarms, and other functions, as well as displaying patient data and waveforms."

          "content": "To change the ventilation mode, the user opens the Modes window, selects the desired mode, adjusts the associated settings as needed, and activates the mode. The ventilator offers CPAP, PCV, S/T, and AVAPS modes, each with its own set of control settings.\n\nControl settings can be adjusted individually or in batches. Individual settings are accessed and adjusted through the Settings window, while batch changes are made through the Modes window. Settings that can be adjusted include IPAP, EPAP, respiratory rate, inspiratory time, rise time, oxygen concentration, and in the AVAPS mode, the minimum and maximum IPAP pressures and target tidal volume.\n\nThe Ramp Time function can be used to gradually increase pressure over a user-set interval, helping the patient adapt to ventilation. The Ramp Time button is selected to start the ramp, and can be selected again to end the ramp or start a new one.\n\nAlarm settings can also be adjusted as needed, with the user able to set limits for parameters like high and low respiratory rate, high and low tidal volume, high inspiratory pressure, and low minute ventilation. The Alarm Settings window is used to access and adjust these alarm limits.\n\nOther ventilator functions include selecting the mask and exhalation port type through the Menu window, which is important for accurate leak and volume monitoring. The exhalation port can also be tested to ensure proper operation.\n\nThe Menu window provides access to additional user preferences, such as adjusting the screen brightness and loudness, viewing ventilator information, locking the screen, and entering standby mode to temporarily suspend ventilation.\n\nThe Help function provides on-screen guidance and information about the ventilator's operation."

Monitored parameters include peak inspiratory pressure, estimated patient leak, patient-triggered breaths, respiratory rate, inspiratory duty cycle, estimated minute ventilation, and estimated exhaled tidal volume.\n\nThe waveform window displays the airway pressure, flow, and volume waveforms. The user can scale the vertical and horizontal axes of the waveforms using the onscreen buttons, and can freeze and unfreeze the waveforms for closer inspection.\n\nAlarms and messages on the ventilator alert the user to conditions that require attention. Alarms can be high-priority, low-priority, or informational messages. High-priority alarms, such as the Check Vent and Vent Inoperative alarms, indicate a critical situation that requires immediate response to ensure patient safety. Low-priority alarms, such as high or low respiratory rate, indicate a less urgent condition. Informational messages provide important information or instructions to the user.\n\nThe user can silence alarms for 2 minutes using the Alarm Silence button, and can manually reset most alarms once the underlying condition is corrected. Some alarms, like the Vent Inoperative alarm, cannot be silenced or reset.\n\nAlarm loudness can be adjusted through the Menu window. Alarms can also be hidden or displayed in the Alarms/Messages list, and autoreset alarms can be cleared from the list.\n\nDetailed tables are provided that list all the alarm and message types, their descriptions, the required corrective actions, and whether they are manually resettable, autoreset, or silenceable."
